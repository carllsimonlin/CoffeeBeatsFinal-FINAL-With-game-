SHIVERS | ===> ED SHEERAN <===

He sings about the feeling he gets when he sees the other person and how it washes away all his pain and leaves him feeling alive. Ed’s love for his new partner is intense; “Every day, I love you more.” He talks about how she makes him feel happy just by being around her.

The song has a very uplifting, positive feel to it. Ed feels very strongly about his new partner and his feelings for her. The chorus says: “I’m sitting in my room all night long/Thinking of you, feeling like a king/Every day I’m loving you more and more/Every day I’m loving you more.” It tells us that he is thinking about his partner every moment of the day and that he wants to spend as much time with her as possible.
