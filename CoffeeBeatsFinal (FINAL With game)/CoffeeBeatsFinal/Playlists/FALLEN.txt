FALLEN | ===> LOLA AMOUR <===

“It’s based on a personal experience (in college). It was with a friend that I got close to. I didn’t feel optimistic about where it would go but happy ako sa feeling na nangyayari. Parang, what if I told you I’ve fallen? Pero never mind,” “Happy na ako sa feeling na yun, pero ayoko i-pursue kasi pampagulo lang siya. I wrote this song right after that whole life event. She knew (about the song) kasi pinakita ko rin sa kanya because we stayed friends.”
