KISAME | ===> RHODESSA <===

The song "Kisame" by Rhodessa speaks of unrequited love and the longing of being with someone who seems to be out of reach. The lyrics are about the narrator's desire to look into the eyes of the person they love who always seem to be far away in another world. They wonder why this person seems to be avoiding them, and why they cannot be closer. The narrator cannot stop thinking about this person and acknowledges that they are always on their mind.
