RAINING IN MANILA | ===> LOLA AMOUR <===

“Cause it’s been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig? Mahirap bang mag isang nanginginig?” Dumayas shares that this part talks about the person who left, but continues to worry about the person left behind.

“Paumanhin at mukhang hindi ko masasabayan ang iyong yapak sa pag-ngiti, sa pag-iyak, sa paglipad at pagbagsak ng araw-araw.” Admittedly, the lines mentioned were just a fancy way of apologizing for not being able to be around the other person’s achievements and be around every day.

“So I’ll be waiting in Manila kahit ‘di ka na babalik.” He finishes the video with a lyric that serves as a reminder that if ever the person comes back, there is someone and something waiting back home—the people and the memories.
