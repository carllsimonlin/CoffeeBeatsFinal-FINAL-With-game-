DIE FOR YOU | ===> JOJI <===

Die For You is a song about processing a breakup. As Joji already tried to do in Glimpse Of Us, also in this song’s lyrics, he elaborates on the sadness and the pain of being alone, far from the girl he loved and still loves.

The song begins with Joji reflecting on his feelings. He feels lonely; the singer doesn’t want to sleep because he misses the sensation of sleeping with the girl he loves. He admits he still needs her “We left it all on read” is a beautiful metaphor recalling how sometimes we don’t answer to people texting us, interrupting the conversation with a message marked as “read” and unanswered. It’s a modern way to describe how we feel when our love leaves unexpectedly through an image everybody can relate to.
